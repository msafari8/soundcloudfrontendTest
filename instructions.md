## SoundCloud Front End Challenges

Greetings, dear candidate,

Thanks for taking the time to do our front end challenges!

In this folder, you'll find some subdirectories, each containing one challenge and a README.md file with the instructions. These deal with different front end skill areas. You might not be equally strong in all areas, but that's ok! We are looking to find out what your skill profile is. Attempt all of the tasks.

In general, what we'd like to see:

- **JavaScript.** Even though Elm might be more your type, we'd prefer to see your JavaScript skills. Same goes for CSS and HTML and their various preprocessors.
- **Modern code.** Outdated browser hacks aren't necessary for these challenges. Knowing how to work around the foibles of IE and Safari are important, but it's not a great use of your time right now. Unless otherwise stated, it only needs to work in latest Chrome and Firefox. As such, we'd like to see how well you know your modern JavaScript -- use all the HTML5 APIs and ES6 features you see fit.
- **Clean code.** Keep it consistently formatted, with a nice balance of comments and self-documenting code. Only write the sort of code you'd like to maintain. Sure, there might be a super clever one liner you could use, but if it's too hard to understand, a more verbose response might be better.
- **Your skills.** We haven't provided libraries in any of the three challenges included here. We feel that what we've supplied, combined with your own coding prowess, should be enough to complete the challenge. That being said, sometimes there is a good case for bringing in some third party code, but if you do, use your judgment and explain why you used an external library.

Good luck, we hope you have fun!

*PS: At SoundCloud, we're always looking to improve everything we do, and these challenges are no exception. If you want to provide any feedback about the process or the individual challenges themselves, please feel free to include a note about it. This is __entirely__ optional: providing negative feedback or none at all won't affect the judging.*

*PPS: Each task's instructions contains the amount of time we estimate it should take to complete. This is provided for your benefit so you can plan your time in advance. It is completely fine if you take more or less time than this -- it is not part of the judging criteria -- but if you could let us know how it went, then we can adjust our estimates for those who come after you.*
